clone()-->we can't clone all objects. for ex- Actor chiranjeevi =new Actor(); if i want same feature to other object loke rajani then we clone,
like,Actor rajani=chiranjeevi;
but we can't clone all objects when we want the same features to other one then we do.
Cloneable,File,Closable  is a interface.
clone-copy
Object class methods-->clone(),equals(),hashcode()-->using hash algorithm to create hashcode,getClass(),teString()

Compare object properties/activities , not objects compare.
We can't override a final methods
String literals-->creating object without new
hashcode is unique ,compare depends on hashcode and equal method.
equal method takes hashcode to compare
toString() help to print a object
hashcode is same for string variable because String is immutable.
StringBuffer over comes String drawback.In string every time hashcode is created so memory is wasted.
Stringbuffer is mutable-->so edited in same memory .The memory is not wasted
StringBuffer refer different memory and String refer same memory
StringBuilder using multithreading
StringBuffers are not use multithreaded.
